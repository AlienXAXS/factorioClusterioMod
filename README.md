# Clusterio

Clusterio allows factorio mods to communicate outside the game. This is the client side mod. To work, 
it also requires a server side mod located at https://github.com/Danielv123/factorioClusterio . It also 
has the full readme, so head over there. 

Another practical side project is the clusterio client, which is a standalone app that makes it easier to 
connect to clusterio servers. Its still very much WIP at the point of writing and not really recommended.
